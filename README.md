# CA_1
CA of a user interface with a sci-fi theme 
I used five classes for my CA 
The first class is the button class that gets passed an x y renders and in the update changes colours the buttons are ment to be the uses representaion of the key presses. They also let you know viually what function is being called.
The meter class is a series of generated rectangles that display at the top of the cockpit they are ment to look like dials, there called in a for loop that creates one every ten pixles.
The radar class generates a radar that sits in the centre of the cockpit, it uses an ellipse and a series of lines that are rotated around a centre point, that when done correctly have a fading colour 
The stars use an array list and are the background they have 100 stars that can be speed up using the key w and slowed down using the key d this gives the impression that the spaceship is moving at hyper speed 
the bullet class generates a red ellipse that moves towards the users mouse x and y,it also creates a cross hairs on the users mouse position
